<h1 align="center"><u>Myself</u></h1>
<p style="color: green; font-size: large   ;">Hi my name is <b>David Olarinde</b>, I am a boy, i am dark in complexion. 
    I am the first child of my family, am from oyo state, I was born on the 27<sup>th</sup>of april 2007. My father is an accountant while my mother is a lecturer.
    I wake up early. I am strong and healthy.
</p>
<p> am studing web development at <strong>Dignity Academy</strong>. I have two 
    siblings. I am very puntual, determined and honest. I have a passion for coding. The course of life is full of ups and downs. if today is not good for us, then we must 
keep hope that everything will be good very soon. All of my virtues have been incorporated in me by my school and helping is one of them
<del>My school</del> aims at the holistic development of a student and it focuses on the fact that we develop both morally as well as academically
it is always part of learning that you try to inculate virtues of yourself by being an honest person. To be responsible and to adhere
to your duties, is what our school teaches us. I joke, laugh and humor people and i also get as much as i give. One important 
to know though is that at first i come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once i get to know people and are comfortable
with my environment i am great. 
</p>
<p>It's hard for me to make friends but once i make them, it's great and i am all different.
I am vey kind,compasionate, sensitive guy as my close friends will tell you. i have a tough shell but on the inside am very soft. 
I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very straight and honest person. I understand
and know that we all put a show sometimes and do not show who we really are or what people think about us. Academically i am a student who likes to be mentally challenged
and i enjoy both hands on my projects as well as conventional learning. I am an enthusiastic drama student and i love to act. My intellectual self is interesting because i am mainly brained 
which means that i tend to use my creativity more than my mathematical skills. My parents may never be around, but i always ensure
that we all go to church on Sunday. I don't consider myself as a good writer. </p>
<p>I write when i am made to or when i have something to say that i can't tell anyone. I keep a diary. Usually my diary is just a record of what i have done that day. It's not so much about my feelings.
I tend to keep my feelings to myself to protect myself from getting hurt.
I am a fan of fotball and i attended the last premier league in amsterdem. I love to press my phone at every opportunity i get. 
The name of my role model is<mark> Elon Musk</mark>, not because he is rich but because i have made a lot of achievement in the technological world
and because he never give up. One of his major achievement is the producion of electricity using cars <strong>teslas</strong> and production
of reuseable rockets when he created his company <ins>spacex</ins>. One major fact about Elon is that he has never not for once 
denied his nationality as an african, South-african to be precise. 
<strong>Thank you.</strong>
